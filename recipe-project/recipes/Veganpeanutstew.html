            <li><span class="quantity">1/2 </span> collard greens (4-6 cups chopped)</li>
            <p class="choice">OPTIONAL GRANISHES</p>
                <li id="optional"><span id="quantity">1/4 bunch cilantro</span></li>
                <li id="optional"><span id="quantity">4.5 cups cooked brown rice</span></li>
                <li id="optional"><span id="quantity">1/3 chopped peanuts</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><em><strong>Steps:</strong></em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and grate the ginger using a small holed cheese grater. Mince the garlic, and dice the onion. Sauté the onion, ginger, and garlic in a large pot with the olive oil over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or until the onion becomes soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>While the onion, ginger, and garlic are sautéing, peel and dice the sweet potato into 1/2-inch cubes. Add the sweet potato cubes, cumin, and red pepper to the pot and continue to sauté for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato paste, peanut butter, and vegetable broth to the pot. Stir until the peanut butter and tomato paste have mostly dissolved into the broth. Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat up to high. Allow the stew to come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to medium-low and allow it to simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are very soft.</li>
            <li>While the soup is simmering, prepare the collard greens. Use a sharp knife to remove each stem (cut along the side of each stem), then stack the leaves and cut them into 1/2-inch wide strips. Place the chopped collard greens in a colander and rinse very well.</li>
            <li>Once the stew has simmered for 15-20 minutes and the sweet potatoes are very soft, stir in the collard greens. Let the stew simmer for about 5 minutes more, then begin to smash the sweet potatoes against the side of the pot to help thicken the stew.</li>
            <li>Finally, taste the stew and add salt or red pepper, if desired. Serve the stew with a scoop of cooked rice (about 3/4 cup), a few chopped peanuts, fresh cilantro, and a drizzle of sriracha, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
